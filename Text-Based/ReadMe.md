# Text Based Practice Programs 

This section contains text-based algorithms and programs. The following are included:

- Reverse a word or phrase
- Check if a word or phrase is a palindrome
- Count the number of vowels in a word or phrase
- Count the number of words in a word or phrase
- Translate a word or phrase into Pig-Latin


### Simple String Reverse 

This program ([found here](String-Reverse)) takes an input string or phrase and gives the reverse, e.g. 

```
./String-Reverse hello

Your input string was: "hello"
"hello" reversed is: "olleh"
```

### Pig-Latin Translator

This program ([found here](pig-latin)) takes an input string or phrase and translates it to Pig Latin e.g. 

```
./pig_latin pig

Your input string was: "pig"
In Pig-Latin this is: "igpay"
```

### Vowel Counter

This program ([found here](vowel-count)) takes an input string or phrase and count the number of vowels, e.g.

```
./vowel_counter hello

Your input string was: "hello"
There are 2 vowels in this string
```

### Word Counter

This program ([found here](word-count)) takes an input string or phrase and count the number of words, e.g.

```
./word_count hello

Your input string was: "hello"
There is 1 word in this string
```

### Palindrome Checker 
This program ([found here](palindrome-check)) takes an input string or phrase and tells the user if it is a palindrome, e.g. 
```
 ./palindrome_check "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!"

Your input string was: "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!"
With punctiation removed this became: "amanaplanacanalpanama"
This string is a paldindrome
```
