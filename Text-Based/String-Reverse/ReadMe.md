# Simple String Reverse 

This program takes an input string or phrase and gives the reverse, e.g. 

```
	./String-Reverse hello
	Your input string was: "hello"
	"hello" reversed is: "olleh"
```


Program is called by: `./String-Reverse <string>` where `<string>` is the user input string. For multiple word phrases, please place the input string in quotation marks e.g. 

```
	./String-Reverse "hello hello"
	Your input string was: "hello hello"
	"hello hello" reversed is: "olleh olleh"
```
