# C++ Programming Practice

This repository contains many different C++ programs used for practicing C++. These projects are designed to learn and/or practice C++ skills. Each project is small in size and intended to test my ability on a specific task so that I can improve my C++ skills in one area at a time.

Files are split into categories and can be run individually. The repo current contains:

- [Text Based](Text-Based) Programs
	- [String Reverse](Text-Based/String-Reverse)
	- [Pig Latin Translator](Text-Based/Pig-Latin)
	- [Vowel Counter](Text-Based/vowel-count)
	- [Word Counter](Text-Based/word-count)
	- [Palindrome Checker](Text-Based/palindrome-check)




To run any of these programs, please refer to the read me instructions in the program folder.
